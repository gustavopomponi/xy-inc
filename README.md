# xy-inc
This project is a java backend used to add and retrieve Points of Interest based on Geolocation and distance on a radius based search.

# Requirements

1) You must have Docker Engine installed and started so you can run docker-compose to bring up the mongodb database, run the scripts and test the application. The reason that mongodb was used is because it provides native geolocation features which makes it easier to retrieve the information we need using native queries.

2) You must have maven installed to run the necessary commands to build, run and test the application.

3) You must run the command "mvn clean install" on the root path of the application to build the project and run the tests.
